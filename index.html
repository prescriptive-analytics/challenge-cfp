                        <h4>With the rising prevalence of smart mobile phones in our daily life, online ride-hailing platforms have emerged as a viable solution to provide more timely and personalized transportation service, led by such companies as DiDi, Uber, and Lyft.  These platforms also allow idle vehicle vacancy to be more effectively utilized to meet the growing need of on-demand transportation, by connecting potential mobility requests to eligible drivers.  In this talk, we will discuss our train of research on ride-hailing marketplace optimization at DiDi, in particular, order dispatching and driver repositioning.  We will show single-agent and multi-agent RL formulations and how value functions can be designed to leverage different amount of information.</h4>

He received his Ph.D. in Operations Research from Columbia University and B.Sc. in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Tony is broadly interested in research topics at the intersection of optimization and machine learning, and most recently in reinforcement learning and its applications in operational optimization, digital marketing, traffic signals control, and education. He has published in top-tier conferences and journals in machine learning and optimization, including ICML, KDD, IEEE ICDM, WWW, JMLR, and MPC.

                        <h4> "An advanced nation is one where the rich people use public transit, and not one, where the poor have cars" said Enrique Penalosa, the celebrated mayor of Bogota. Inspired by this idea, in this project we rethink the ways to improve the public transit experience and convert more auto commuters to public transit. We a holistic view of all the stakeholders involved, namely, transit operator, commuter and local businesses (the latter rely on transportation systems to bring in customers) and we look among other things into what types of information will help commuters make the transition to public transit, how local businesses can help improve the public transit experience and how we can make this without increasing inequalities in the population.</h4>
